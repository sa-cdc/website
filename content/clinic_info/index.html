            services for low-income and homeless persons in San Antonio and Bexar County.  SACDC is unique in the area as the only agency providing free dental care through volunteers.</h5>

        <h5 class="text-center">Each year the San Antonio Christian Dental
          Clinic performs nearly $3.5 million dollars worth of free dental care,
          over 60,000 annual procedures and 7,000 patient visits. While we mainly see those in and around the Haven for Hope area, we take anyone from Bexar County who lacks the means to afford quality dental care.</h5>
