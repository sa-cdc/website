      <h4>The fact is that while dental disease is easily treated and prevented, poor dental health has the potential to threaten nutrition, speech, and general health.  Visible decay can erode self-confidence, personal interactions, and have a huge effect on employability.</h4>

      <h4>Across the country, an estimated 130 million Americans lack dental insurance.  Challenges, including the high cost of dental insurance and a lack of low-cost dental services, affect low-income families and Hispanics disproportionately.</h4>

      <h3 class="story">Access:</h3></br>
      <h4>Locally, the 2013 Bexar County Community Health Assessment reported that only 47% of Bexar County residents with less than a high school degree and 44% of those with household incomes less than $25,000 reported a dental visit in the past year and only 41% of the county overall. In fact, 1/5th of Bexar County Adults say they haven’t received oral care in five years!<br>As a state, Texas has one of the lowest dentist to population ratios in the country, with a state average of 35 dentists for every 100,000 residents.  This is roughly half the national average and is exacerbated by the fact that “dental deserts” often exist in the urban core of major cities like San Antonio.</h4>
