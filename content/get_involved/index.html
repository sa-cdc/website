        <h3>Why Get Involved</h3>
        <p>Volunteers are crucial to the success of our agency. In fact, each year SACDC relies upon its nearly 300 volunteers to bring help healing and hope to almost 8,000 patients. With so much need in our community, there is a need for nearly eery kind of skill!</p>

        <p><em>"The staff and volunteers of the Christian Dental clinic have given me my smile back and have made me feel like I have been reborn. Now I can smile and not feel ashamed of my teeth. I am just so very grateful that there is a place people can go to get their teeth fixed for little or nothing at all. The clinic has changed my life and the lives of many others over the years."</em></p>
